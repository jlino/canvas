# What does it mean for a system to think infinitely?
- Question: What does it mean for a system to think infinitely?
- Answer: The system’s thoughts never cease; they continuously evolve and expand.
- Inspect: How do we know when the system has “thought” enough, or has reached a limit?
- Evolve: As answers create more questions, how do we track their transformation?
- Question (again): What does infinite thinking look like when we look at it as a whole?
